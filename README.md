ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, C#. Also really want to learn JS in the future.\n 
ðŸ’» Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on game dev when I learn something more. I love video games since I was little kid.\n
ðŸš€ I had internship on Polish Space Agency - Defense Department in Warsaw. 
ðŸŽ‡ I also had workship on Heavy Ion Laboratory in Warsaw.

âš¡ Fun fact: I never thought I'll be programist. Honestly at my first uni I hated it, especially I'm poet by heart lmao. But this love's still blooming and it makes me happy the most. I want to learn as much as I can. IT becomes me new best friend so per aspera ad astra or something haha. So... Hello world!
