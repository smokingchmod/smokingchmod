### Hi there 👋

<!--
**smokingchmod/smokingchmod** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, C#. Also really want to learn JS in the future.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on game dev when I learn something more.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I never thought I'll be programist. Honestly at my first uni I hated it, especially I'm poet lmao. But this love's still blooming and it makes me happy the most. I want to learn as much as I can. IT becomes me new best friend so per aspera ad astra or something haha. Hello world!
